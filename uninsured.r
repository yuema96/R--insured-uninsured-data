# Part 1: Calculate and plot the percentage of uninsured individuals based on data in `uninsured2012.csv`; your visualization should convey the percentage of uninsured individuals for each state. 

# Part 2: Sort the states by population, where the most populated state is listed first. Again plot the percentage of uninsured individuals for each state.

# Part 3: Using both the `uninsured2012.csv` and `regions.csv` datasets, produce a visualization that encodes the insured and uninsured by each region.
